                                        <p align="justify">The Sinovac Vaccine and sold under the brand name CoronaVac is an inactivated vaccine for COVID-19 developed by the Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac.
                                        
                                        The Sinovac vaccine has received approval from China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) to conduct Phase I/II human clinical trials in China as of April 13, 2020, to determine the vaccine candidate's safety, tolerance, dosage, and immunisation schedule.
                                        
                                        On February 3, 2021, <a href = "https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30987-7/fulltext"><em>The Lancet</em></a> published a study that concluded 'CoronaVac was well tolerated and induced humoral responses in adults aged 60 years and older, which supports this vaccine's use in an older population.'

                                        <h2 class="card-title h3 mb-3 text-left">How does this vaccine work?</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">It works by using dormant/deactivated viral particles and injecting them into the body and exposing the deactivated viral strands to the body without triggering a severe immune response.
                                        
                                        In essence, inactivated vaccines use a pathogen that has been modified so that it cannot replicate to stimulate our immune system.

                                        <p align="justify">As of currently, it is still unclear to place an exact percentage of efficacy on the Sinovac vaccine as various trials from other countries showed different results.
                                        
                                        CoronaVac has been undergoing phase three trials in various countries. Interim data from late-stage trials in Turkey and Indonesia showed that the vaccine was 91.25% and 65.3% effective respectively. Researchers in Brazil initially said it was 78% effective in their clinical trials, but in January 2021 revised that figure to 50.4% after including more data in their calculations.
                                        
                                        Meanwhile, the vaccine reported 79% efficacy in an interim evaluation.
                                        
                                        As of April 6 2021, Researchers from Turkey reported CoronaVac's immunity rate was 25.3% after 28 days of the first dose and 97.92% after 28 days upon receiving the second vaccine dose. The effective antibody response was found to be 29.5% in women after the first vaccine; 18.6% in males.

                                        <p  align="justify">Preliminary results from a large study of healthcare workers suggest that one dose of CoronaVac is still about 50% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 in a Brazilian city where more than three-fourths of new cases are caused by the highly transmissable variant known as P.1.
                                        
                                        The 49.6% real-world effectiveness is similar to the vaccine's efficacy of 50.34% against symptomatic COVID-19 after both doses, found in a phase 3 clinical trial conducted in Brazil by the Butantan Institute, a state-owned research institute and vaccinemaker.

                                        <h2 class="card-title h3 mb-3 text-left">Benefits of the Sinovac Vaccine</h2>
                                        <p  align="justify">Experts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus that are emerging.
                                            
                                            On paper, one of Sinovac's main advantages is that it can be stored in a standard 
                                            refrigerator at 2 to 8Â°C (Degrees Celsius).
                                            
                                            This means that the Sinovac vaccine is more useful to developing countries which might not be able to store large amounts of vaccine vials at extremely low temperatures.
