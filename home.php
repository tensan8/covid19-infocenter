                                            Coronavirus disease 2019 or also known as COVID-19 
                                            is a respiratory syndrome that was caused
                                            by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. This respiratory 
                                            illness was first identified in Wuhan, China.
                                            A really fast spreading of this virus has made a lot of 
                                            countries to get into lockdown in order to stop the 
                                            spreading of this virus. However, COVID-19 becomes worse 
                                            and on March 11, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) 
                                            had declared that this COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, 
                                            which means that this virus has spread worldwide.

                                        <p>
                                            This virus, that was spread by the infected droplets being inhaled 
                                            by the person who does not have this virus, has caused a lot of loss.
                                            There has been more than 
                                            <strong class="highlight">125,000,000 confirmed cases</strong> 
                                            of COVID-19 with more than 
                                            <strong class="highlight">2,500,000 deaths</strong>.

                                            over 2020, causing some countries to suffer from economic recession.
                                            Several ways have been done in order to stop the spread of this virus 
                                            and to end this pandemic, starting from practicing social distancing, 
                                            using mask, quarantine, lockdown, and vaccines.

                                            One of several ways that we can do in order 
                                            to prevent COVID-19 is by getting vaccinated.
                                            A lot of people are still afraid of COVID-19 
                                            vaccines because of several reasons.
                                            Vaccination is actually a safe and effective way 
                                            to protect human from harmful diseases.
                                            A lot of vaccines have been developed and being 
                                            used for decades, such as the vaccine for tetanus.
                                        </p>       
                                        <p>
                                            A lot of people are afraid with vaccine because 
                                            vaccine contains viruses or bacteria. The thing that 
                                            we need to know here is that, the viruses or the bacteria, 
                                            that were used for these vaccines, have been 
                                            <strong class="highlight">weakened</strong>. 
                                            This weakened viruses will train 
                                            our natural immune system to produce the 
                                            antibodies, hence we will have a lower probability of being infected.
                                        </p>      
                                        <p>
                                            We should not be worried that the vaccine may 
                                            make us to have a serious illness. 
                                            Some side-effects from vaccine such as mild 
                                            fever or sore arm are normal because our body 
                                            is still trying to produce the antibodies.
                                            All of these vaccines have been tested by professional 
                                            healt care and being approved by international health organization.
                                            Being vaccinated is not only about protecting ourselves, 
                                            but it will also protect our family and the beloved ones.
