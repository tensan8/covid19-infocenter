                                            Coronavirus disease 2019 or also known as COVID-19 is a respiratory syndrome that was caused
                                            by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. This respiratory illness was first identified in Wuhan, China.
                                            A really fast spreading of this virus has made a lot of countries to get into lockdown in order to stop the 
                                            spreading of this virus. However, COVID-19 becomes worse and on March 11, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) 
                                            had declared that this COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, which means that this virus has spread worldwide.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This virus, that was spread by the infected droplets being inhaled by the person who does not have this virus, has caused a lot of loss.
                                            There has been more than <strong>125,000,000 confirmed cases</strong> of COVID-19 with more than <strong>2,500,000 deaths</strong>.
                                            There are also around <strong>114 Million people loss their job</strong> over 2020, causing some countries to suffer from economic recession.
                                            Several ways have been done in order to stop the spread of this virus and to end this pandemic, starting from practicing social distancing, 
                                            using mask, quarantine, lockdown, and vaccines.

                                            One of several ways that we can do in order to prevent COVID-19 is by getting vaccinated.
                                            A lot of people are still afraid of COVID-19 vaccines because of several reasons.
                                            Vaccination is actually a safe and effective way to protect human from harmful diseases.
                                            A lot of vaccines have been developed and being used for decades, such as the vaccine for tetanus.
                                        </p>       
                                        <p>
                                            A lot of people are afraid with vaccine because vaccine contains viruses or bacteria. The thing that 
                                            we need to know here is that, the viruses or the bacteria, that were used for these vaccines, have been 
                                            <strong>weakened</strong>. This weakened viruses will train our natural immune system to produce the 
                                            antibodies, hence we will have a lower probability of being infected.
                                        </p>      
                                        <p>
                                            We should not be worried that the vaccine may make us to have a serious illness. Some side-effects from vaccine 
                                            such as mild fever or sore arm are normal because our body is still trying to produce the antibodies.
                                            All of these vaccines have been tested by professional healt care and being approved by international health organization.
                                            Being vaccinated is not only about protecting ourselves, but it will also protect our family and the beloved ones.
