                                        <p align="justify">It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to look more like coronavirus - although it can't cause illness. 
                                            Once injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus. Unlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can 
                                            be stored in a normal fridge. This makes it much easier to distribute.

                                        <p align="justify">It is not yet known how long protection lasts with any of the coronavirus vaccines.A study found that 
                                            unvaccinated people who have had Covid, develop protection for at least six months. Vaccines are likely to provide stronger protection than this.
                                            It may be that people need annual vaccinations, as happens with the flu jab.

                                        <h2 class="card-title h3 mb-3 text-left">Does the vaccine protect against new variants?</h2>
                                        <p  align="justify">Experts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus that are emerging.
                                            Government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is "plenty of evidence" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant that is dominant in the UK.                                            
                                            There is less evidence about protection for other ones, such as the Brazil and the South Africa variants.
                                            A study based on about 2,000 people with the vaccine, suggests the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine offers limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant.                                            
                                            South Africa has paused roll-out while it investigates further.
                                            There is no evidence to suggest it would not be effective at preventing more severe cases that need hospital treatment.
                                            UK scientists are working on new versions of the vaccine, to keep up with a virus that will inevitably keep mutating.
